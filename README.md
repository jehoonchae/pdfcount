# pdfcount

This is a simple package and shiny app designed to count words in a PDF document, for example generated by LaTeX.

You can use the package locally:

```R
# install
remotes::install_github("leeper/pdfcount")

# load
library("pdfcount")

# count
rintro <- file.path(Sys.getenv("R_HOME"), "doc", "manual", "R-intro.pdf")
word_count(rintro)
```

Or, you can use it as a shiny app. A demo runs live at: https://leeper.shinyapps.io/pdfcount/
